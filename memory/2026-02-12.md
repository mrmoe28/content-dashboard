# Daily Log - 2026-02-12

*Raw notes from today. Significant items get curated into MEMORY.md periodically.*

## Sessions

### Setup Session
- Reviewed workspace files and configuration
- Created memory structure (MEMORY.md, memory/ directory, daily logs)
- Identified security concerns: API keys in plain text in openclaw.json

## Observations

### Configuration Status
- OpenClaw system operational with multiple models available
- LM Studio and Ollama providers configured and ready
- 40+ skills enabled across services (Discord, GitHub, Slack, etc.)
- WhatsApp and voice-call plugins active

### Issues Found
- **SECURITY:** API keys stored in openclaw.json (ElevenLabs, OpenAI, Perplexity, Twilio)
  - Recommendation: Move to environment variables or secure vault
- USER.md is empty - needs human context
- HEARTBEAT.md doesn't exist - should create for proactive periodic checks
- Backup config files (.bak files) could be archived or cleaned

## Next Steps
- [x] Move API keys to environment variables
- [x] Verify no hardcoded keys remain
- [x] Change model to Mistral 3 14B Reasoning

## Model Change (Completed)
- Primary model changed from GLM 4.6V Flash to `lmstudio/mistralai/ministral-3-14b-reasoning`
- Reason: Better for social media automation (reasoning capability + acceptable speed)
- Tested GPT-OSS 20B but it was unresponsive (hung/too slow)
- User had to manually restart gateway (kill-restart.ps1 improved)

## Technical Notes
- LM Studio running on port 1234
- Gateway running on ws://127.0.0.1:18789
- WhatsApp handler active
- kill-restart.ps1 script improved to handle startup verification better

## System Prompt Implementation

**Problem:** Agent was responding with exec commands instead of natural chat to WhatsApp.

**Solution:** Created and configured system prompt:
- Created [SYSTEM_PROMPT.md](SYSTEM_PROMPT.md) with agent persona aligned to mrmoe28's style
- Added systemPrompt to openclaw.json agents.defaults
- Agent now instructed to: be casual/concise, answer directly, use tools only when asked
- No more random command execution - stays conversational
